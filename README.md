# Obscura-Vision
Obscura-Vision is a machine learning project designed to recognize actions in blurry videos. The project leverages two different models—CNN+LSTM and TimeSformer—to evaluate and compare their performance in action recognition tasks. Additionally, MLFlow is used to track and showcase model performance metrics and results.
